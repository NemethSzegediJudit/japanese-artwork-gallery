# The Art of Japanese Prints

### About
On this website you can browse Japanese prints and their details from [Harvard Art Museums API]( https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/api).

### Motivation
Originally this project was one of my group projects in Codecool, in which we practiced React. Later I improved the design and implemented more features.
### Collaborators
The members of thumbRules group: Ghyczy András, Kovács Patrik, Mikulásné Turzó Krisztina, Németh-Szegedi Judit, Szilágyi András.

### How to start the project
If you would like to run the project on your local development environment, install dependencies both in the backend folder and in the artworks folder with `npm install`, and after that run them with `npm start`.


Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

### Requirements
It's recommended to use one of the latest versions of modern web browsers.
### How to use
